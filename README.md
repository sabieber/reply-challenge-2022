## Challenge summary

In the fantasy world of Replyland, legends say that in the ancient times there was a jar hidden by the Gods in a cave, on the peak of the highest mountain. No one knew what was in the jar; some said it contained eternal fortune, others terrible disgrace. Only one man dared to challenge the fate and climb up the mountain to take the jar: Epimetheus. He was power-thirsty and sure the jar could give him the means to defeat anyone.

Once back in his village, he gathered everyone in the square and opened the jar... a Shadow emerged from it and exploded in thousand of pieces, that scattered all over Replyland. The sky thundered and a deep voice an- nounced: “You dared to open the jar and free all the evils and sins ever known. Only a hero can now gather all the demons and put them back in the box”. Pandora, Epimetheus’ wife, emerged from the crowd and said: “My husband was that foolish to challenge the fortune and open the sacred jar. I will challenge the demons to restore the balance.” Everyone knew and re- spected Pandora: she was keen to the magic of light and nature, and a very powerful healer. The voice thus declared: “So be it. Get ready, your journey will start immediately.”

Your task is to help Pandora in facing the perils of her mission. Choose carefully the enemies to face, and collect as many fragments of the Shadow as possible!

## Learnings / Potentials

- Find result viewer sooner to more easily see where solution falls short / could be optimized
- Take the benefit of waiting rounds into account instead of picking an enemy every round
- Include a score calculation earlier so intermediate solutions are only uploaded when they are improving the score
- Maintaining version control / commits is not really feasible for such a short hackathon
- IntelliJ "Code With Me" feature works great
- Was a lot of fun :)
